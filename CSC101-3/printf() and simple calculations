1. This is the first program which introduces the use of *printf()*. 

```
#include<iostream>  //Preprocessor Directives (this is an example of inline comment starting with //)

/* This is an example of blocked comment which means that if you want to create multilined comments then it should be enclosed this way.
	And this comment is going to tell you more about this program, that this will do some printing job
*/

int main()                                       // main is a miscelleneous function. Your program should have exactly one main() function
{
	printf("Hello World! \n");                     // printf() is a function, which prints on console the value we give it as an input
                                                 // In the line above, \n is used to feed new line on the console. \n is an escape character
	printf("Welcome to \\CSC101\\. \n\n"); 
	printf("Socarates said,\t \"Man is mortal\""); // \t is another escape character, which insert 4 spaces in the console
	return 0;                                      // returning the value 0
}
```

2. The following program creates a simple integer type variable named _taka_. This program takes the amount in taka as input from the user and convert it into dollars. 

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int taka;
    std::cout << "Enter BD taka:";
    std::cin >> taka;

    float dollar = taka / 84.73;
    //std::cout << "BDT " << taka << " = $" << dollar << std::endl;
    printf("BDT %d = $%.2f\n", taka, dollar);
}
```

3. The program below calculates the time difference between two given times. *Input* of the program are four integer values, starting time in hours _sh_, starting time in minutes _sm_, ending time in houres _eh_ and ending time in minutes _em_. *Output* of the program is the time difference in minutes _totalminutes_, assuming that the starting and ending time is always in a single day and ending hour is always greater than starting hours. 

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int s_h;
	int s_m;
	int e_h;
	int e_m;

	std::cout << "Enter starting hours:";
	std::cin >> s_h;
	std::cout << "Enter starting minutes:";
	std::cin >> s_m;

	std::cout << "Enter ending hours:";
	std::cin >> e_h;
	std::cout << "Enter ending minutes:";
	std::cin >> e_m;
	

	int start_time = s_h * 60 + s_m;
	int end_time = e_h * 60 + e_m;

	int totalminutes = end_time - start_time;

	printf("total minute = %d", totalminutes);

}
```
