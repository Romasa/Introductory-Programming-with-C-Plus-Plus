# Iterative Statements or Loops
Whenever you want to do some task repetitively then we needs to learn a new tool which can perform this task. This tool is called Iterative Statements or Loops in C++ language. 
There are three different types of loops provided in C++:

1. While Loop
2. For Loop
3. Do-while Loop


## While Loop

While loop provides a very simplistic skeleton to perform the iterative tasks. For example, with the help of while loop, numbers from 1 to 10 can be printed using the following program:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int num = 1;

	while (num <= 10)
	{
		cout << num << endl;
		num = num + 1;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

In the above program, we are doing a repetitive task of printing a number starting from 1 and every time we increment the value of the number so that next number can be printed. This procedures runs for 10 times in the above example.

Lets modify the above program so that inside loop, we can calculate the sum of all the numbers which is provided to us. 
The program below, takes 5 integer numbers as input from the user and perform the summation of those numbers inside the loop. Later on this program prints the result of the summation.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int count = 1;
	float x, sum = 0 ;
	while (count <= 5)
	{
		count++;
		cout << "Enter any value;";
		cin >> x;

		sum = sum + x;
	}
	cout << "Sum = " << sum << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Moving forward, next program shows you the example of taking a range as input from the user and print all the even numbers in between of the given range. So, the first task here is to take two integer numbers as inputs from the user, the first number of the range and the last number of the range. This should be done outside of the loop because it has nothing to do with iterations. After that, we will run a loop which will start from the first number of the range, and check whether it is even or not, if the value is even then that number is printed otherwise not. The loop with increment the value of the variable to reach the next number of the range and check whether it is even or not. This procedure will continue until the loop reaches the last number of the range, check it and then the loop terminates itself.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int startValue, endValue;

	cout << "Enter the start value:";
	cin >> startValue; // 3
	cout << "Enter the end value:";
	cin >> endValue; // 9

	int num = startValue; // num = 3
	while (num <= endValue) //  3 <= 9 = > T , 4 <= 9 = > T ..... 10 <= 9 => F
	{
		if (num % 2 == 0) // 3% 2 == 0=> F, 4 % 2 == 0 => T
		{
			cout << num << endl; // 4 will be printed
		}
		num++; // num = num + 1 // 3 =  3 + 1 => 4
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Now lets take a little bit mathematical problem. You must know about the factorial thing. Factorial is a mathematical concept and is mathematically representated by *n!*. So if the value of n is 5 the *5!* means *5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1* which equals to **120**. For n = 7, n! => 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 =  5040. For different values of n the result is different and it increases drastically with the higher values of n. You can observe that calculating the factorial of a number is a repetitive task, the given number is multiplied by one lesser value and this procedure is continued till the number is boiled down to 1. So, we can write a program for that too.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x;
	cout << "Enter a value to find factorial:";
	cin >> x;
	int num = x;
	unsigned long long fact = 1;

	while (num > 1)
	{
		fact = fact * num;
		num--; // num = num - 1;
	}
	cout << "factorial of " << x << " is " << fact << endl;
}
```

The above program uses unsigned long long variable to keep the result of the factorial because integer variable can only hold the result of factorial of n equals to upto 16, after which c++ integers start to overflow. Unsigned int variables can show the result of upto n = 33 and after which it overflows. If we use long long, then the factorial of atmost 39! can be calculated. Unsigned long long variable can hold the result of n upto 69 and this is the maximum which can we achieve using a single data type. We will learn to calculate the factorial of bigger numbers after learning some more programming tools
