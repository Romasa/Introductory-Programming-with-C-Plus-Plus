# Iterative Statements or Loops
Whenever you want to do some task repetitively then we needs to learn a new tool which can perform this task. This tool is called Iterative Statements or Loops in C++ language. 
There are three different types of loops provided in C++:

1. While Loop
2. For Loop
3. Do-while Loop


## While Loop

While loop provides a very simplistic skeleton to perform the iterative tasks. For example, with the help of while loop, numbers from 1 to 10 can be printed using the following program:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int num = 1;

	while (num <= 10)
	{
		cout << num << endl;
		num = num + 1;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

In the above program, we are doing a repetitive task of printing a number starting from 1 and every time we increment the value of the number so that next number can be printed. This procedures runs for 10 times in the above example.

Lets modify the above program so that inside loop, we can calculate the sum of all the numbers which is provided to us. 
The program below, takes 5 integer numbers as input from the user and perform the summation of those numbers inside the loop. Later on this program prints the result of the summation.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int count = 1;
	float x, sum = 0 ;
	while (count <= 5)
	{
		count++;
		cout << "Enter any value;";
		cin >> x;

		sum = sum + x;
	}
	cout << "Sum = " << sum << endl;
	return 0;
}
```
Lets see a similar kind of problem where we are taking 5 integer numbers as input from the user and calculating the sum of positive numbers only.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int count = 1;
	float x, sum = 0;

	while (count <= 5)
	{
		cout << "Enter any number:";
		cin >> x;

		if (x > 0)
			sum = sum + x;
		count++;
	}

	cout << "Sum of non-negative numbers: " << sum << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Moving forward, next program shows you the example of taking a range as input from the user and print all the even numbers in between of the given range. So, the first task here is to take two integer numbers as inputs from the user, the first number of the range and the last number of the range. This should be done outside of the loop because it has nothing to do with iterations. After that, we will run a loop which will start from the first number of the range, and check whether it is even or not, if the value is even then that number is printed otherwise not. The loop with increment the value of the variable to reach the next number of the range and check whether it is even or not. This procedure will continue until the loop reaches the last number of the range, check it and then the loop terminates itself.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int startValue, endValue;

	cout << "Enter the start value:";
	cin >> startValue; // 3
	cout << "Enter the end value:";
	cin >> endValue; // 9

	int num = startValue; // num = 3
	while (num <= endValue) //  3 <= 9 = > T , 4 <= 9 = > T ..... 10 <= 9 => F
	{
		if (num % 2 == 0) // 3% 2 == 0=> F, 4 % 2 == 0 => T
		{
			cout << num << endl; // 4 will be printed
		}
		num++; // num = num + 1 // 3 =  3 + 1 => 4
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Now lets take a little bit mathematical problem. You must know about the factorial thing. Factorial is a mathematical concept and is mathematically representated by *n!*. So if the value of n is 5 the *5!* means *5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1* which equals to **120**. For n = 7, n! => 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 =  5040. For different values of n the result is different and it increases drastically with the higher values of n. You can observe that calculating the factorial of a number is a repetitive task, the given number is multiplied by one lesser value and this procedure is continued till the number is boiled down to 1. So, we can write a program for that too.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x;
	cout << "Enter a value to find factorial:";
	cin >> x;
	int num = x;
	unsigned long long fact = 1;

	while (num > 1)
	{
		fact = fact * num;
		num--; // num = num - 1;
	}
	cout << "factorial of " << x << " is " << fact << endl;
}
```

The above program uses unsigned long long variable to keep the result of the factorial because integer variable can only hold the result of factorial of n equals to upto 16, after which c++ integers start to overflow. Unsigned int variables can show the result of upto n = 33 and after which it overflows. If we use long long, then the factorial of atmost 39! can be calculated. Unsigned long long variable can hold the result of n upto 69 and this is the maximum which can we achieve using a single data type. We will learn to calculate the factorial of bigger numbers after learning some more programming tools

### Effect of Pre-increment and Post-increment Inside Loop

Lets see a very interesting example of pre-increment and post increment. Observe the following programs:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i = 1;

	/* Post Increment */
	while (i++ <= 10)
	{
		cout << i << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
```

Now lets rewrite the program to make it use pre-increment:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i = 1;

	/*Pre Increment*/
	while (++i <= 10)
	{
		cout << i << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
```

Analyse the output of the two programs and keep in mind that when post-increment is used inside any equation or expression then, all other operations of the expression is performed first and at the end increment is performed, hence the name post-increment. In the case of pre-increment, if pre-increment is used inside the expression of equation then at first the increment operation is performed then all other operations of the expression will be performed, hence the name pre-increment. 


## For Loop

The same factorial program can be done with the other type of the loop which is called For Loop, the code of which is given below:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x;
	unsigned long long int fact = 1;
	
	cout << "Enter any number to calculate factorial:";
	cin >> x;

	for ( ; x > 1; x--)
	{
		fact = fact * x;
	}
	cout << "Factorial is " << fact << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

To understand the for loop, lets revisit the problem of printing numbers from 1 - 10.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	for (int count = 1; count <= 10; count++)
	{
		cout << count << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Its time to dig deep in to some mathematical problem which also uses functions to perform part of the task. The problem here is to calculate the geomatric sum. The geometric series can mathematically be defined as a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^n. To perform this famous mathematical sum programmatically, we need three inputs , a,r and n. So lets write a program which can perform the geometric sum.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int Power(int base, int exp);
int GeometricSeries(int a, int r, int n);

int main()
{
	int a, r, n, sum = 0;
	cout << "Calculating Geometric Series" << endl << endl;
	cout << "Enter the value of a:";
	cin >> a; // 5
	cout << "Enter the value of r:";
	cin >> r; // 2
	cout << "Enter the value of n:";
	cin >> n; // 3

	sum = GeometricSeries(a, r, n);
	cout << "Result of Geometric series = " << sum <<endl;
	return 0;
}

int Power(int base, int exp)
{
	int result = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= exp; i++) //i = 1, i = 2, i = 3, i = 4, i = 5
	{
		result = result * base;//1*2=>2, 2*2=>4, 4*2=>8, 8*2=> 16
	}
	return result;
}

int GeometricSeries(int a, int r, int n)
{
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) // i=0, i=1, i=2, i=3, i=4
	{
		sum = sum + (a * Power(r, i));
		//0 + (5*1)=>5, 5+(5*2)=>15,
		//15+(5*(4))=>35, 35+(5*(8))=>75
	}
	return sum;
}
```
## For and while loop can be used interchangably 

For loop and while loop can replace each other in almost all the cases with a little bit of adjustments . The program below shows you the contrast between the two loops where Hello World is printed three times using while loop and then for loop. 

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i = 0; // initialization

	while (i < 3) // condition
	{
		cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
		i++; // update
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	{
		cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
	}

	return 0;
}
```

## Do-While Loop

Do-while is a special type of loop which guarantees iteration of atleast one time. While and For loop can get their conditions false even at the very first iteration and can never perform the operations written inside the loop at all but do-while loop will perform all the operations written inside its scope for atleast once and later on check the condition to iterate over again. No other loop can replace do-while loop in this property. Lets see an example of do-while loop which keeps on taking input and print it on the console as long as the user enters positive number. The moment user enters a negative number, the loop terminates.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x;

	do
	{
		cout << "Enter any number: ";
		cin >> x;
		cout << "You have entered " << x << endl;
	} while (x >= 0);
}
```

## Nested Loops

The need of nested loop arises whenever we need to increase our dimension. So far, we have written only in rows, but what if the process has to be done for every columns of each rows (the problem just become 2 dimensional). To solve this type of problems we need nested loops, which means, using loops inside loop. The classical problem to demonstrate nested loops is to print some geomatrical shapes.

For example, the below program prints a square, given the number of rows of the square to be printed:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

/*
	******
	******
	******
	******
	******
	******

	*/
int main1()
{
	int blockSize;
	cout << "Enter the block size in numbers:";
	cin >> blockSize; // 3
	/*
	for (int i = 0; i < blockSize; i++) // i = 0, i = 1,i = 2
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < blockSize; j++) // j=0, j=1, j=2, j=3
		{
			cout << "* "; 
			// * * *
			// * * * 
			// * * *
		}
		cout << endl;
	}*/

	int i = 0;

	while (i < blockSize)
	{
		int j = 0;
		while (j < blockSize)
		{
			cout << "* ";
			j++ ;
		}
		cout << endl;
		i++;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

The programs below prints right angled triangle:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

/*

		*
		**
		***
		****
		*****
		******

*/
int main()
{
	int length;
	cout << "Enter the length of triangle:";
	cin >> length;

	for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < (i+1); j++)
		{
			cout << "* ";
		}
		cout << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
