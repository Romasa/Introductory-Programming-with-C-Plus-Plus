# Functions

## Example of a built-in function pow()
We have used functions already, ain't we. The program below calls a built-in function named pow() which takes base and exponent as the input parameters and returns base raised to the power of given exponent value. Here you go:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int base, exp;
	cout << "Enter the value of base:";
	cin >> base;
	cout << "Enter the value of exponent:";
	cin >> exp;

	int result = pow(exp, base); // Calling a built-in function which returns the value of base^exponent
	cout << result << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Well, main() is also a function which we have already defined ourselves from the start till now ;-)

## User-defined Functions (Lets do it)

As for a basic example of a function to understand its syntax, a function ManIsMortal() is being called from the main() function. ManIsMortal() is a one function which neither accept any parameters nor returns anything at the end of its execution.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void ManIsMortal();  // Function Prototype

int main()
{
	ManIsMortal(); // Function Call 
	cout << "Socrates is a man. " << endl;
	return 0;
}

// Function Declaration
void ManIsMortal()
{
	cout << "All men are mortal. ";
}

```

In the program below, four different functions are written which greets the user with four different languages. These functions accepts no input parameters and returns nothings. In the below version of this program, all the functions are called from main() function. So everytime the control of the program goes to the calling function and returns back to main() function after the execution of the function is finished.
For example, when the InBengali() function is called from the main() function, then the control of compiler leaves the main() function for a while and goes to InBengali() function, once all the statements of the InBengali() functions are completed, the control returns back to the main() function

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;



void InBengali(); // These are Function Prototype / Function Signature
void InGerman();
void InFrench();
void InEnglish();

int main()
{
	InBengali(); // This is how a function is called. Here InBengali() function is called
  InGerman();  // This is how a function is called. Here InGerman() function is called
  InEnglish();  // This is how a function is called. Here InEnglish() function is called
  InFrench();  // This is how a function is called. Here InFrench() function is called
	return 0;
}

// This is the function definition
void InEnglish()
{
	cout << "Good Evening" << endl;
}

// This is the function definition
void InBengali()
{
	cout << "Shubo Shondha " << endl;
}

// This is the function definition
void InGerman()
{
	cout << "Guten Abend" << endl;
}

// This is the function definition
void InFrench()
{
	cout << "Bonjoir" << endl;
}
```

In another version of the above program, functions are not called from the main() functions only, different functions are calling to one another, now run and analyse the result of the following program. For your better understanding, few messages are printed inside the functions.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;



void InBengali(); // Function Prototype / Function Signature
void InGerman();
void InFrench();
void InEnglish();

int main()
{
	cout << "I am main" << endl;
	InBengali();
	cout << "Exiting from main" << endl;
	return 0;
}

void InEnglish()
{
	cout << "Going to England: ";
	cout << "Good Evening" << endl;
	InGerman();
	cout << "Exiting from England" << endl;
}

void InBengali()
{
	cout << "Going to Bangladesh: ";
	cout << "Shubo Shondha " << endl;
	InEnglish();
	cout << "Exiting from Bangladesh" << endl;
}

void InGerman()
{
	cout << "Going to Germany: ";
	cout << "Guten Abend" << endl;
	InFrench();
	cout << "Exiting from Germany" << endl;
}

void InFrench()
{
	cout << "Going to France: ";
	cout << "Bonjoir" << endl;
	cout << "Exiting from France" << endl;
}

```

The previous problem  calls a function without any parameters and the functions didn't return anything as well. In the example below, main() function is calling a function named calSum() with three parameters/ arguments and getting the sum of these parameters as return. The result returned from calSum() is printed in the main() function.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int calSum(int x, int y, int z);

int main()
{
	int a, b, c;
	cin >> a >> b >> c;

	int result = calSum(a, b, c);
	cout << "sum = " << result <<endl;
	return 0;
}

int calSum(int x, int y, int z)
{
	int r = x + y + z;
	return r;
}
```

Now can we write a similar function like the pow() function mentioned above. For the sake of simplicity, the function will take a base and compute its squared value only and return the result to the calling function, which is main() in our case right now.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

float square(float x);

void main()
{
	float num;
	cout << "Enter any number to square:";
	cin >> num;
	float res = square(num);
	cout << "Square of " << num << " = " << res << endl;
}

/*	User defined function, which calculates the square value of a given number and return the result
	Function name: square
	Input: float type variable
	Output: returns a float value
*/
float square(float x)
{
	
	float result;
	result = x * x;
	return result;
}
```

We can write a simple calculator program which takes two numbers and an operator as input and perform the required operation between the numbers.

```
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

float Add(float x, float y);
float Sub(float x, float y);
float Mul(float x, float y);
float Div(float x, float y);

int main()
{
	float a, b, r;
	char op;
	cout << "Enter first operand: ";
	cin >> a;

	cout << "Enter second operand:";
	cin >> b;

	cout << "Select the operation (+, -, * ,/):";
	cin >> op;

	switch (op)
	{
	case '+':
		r = Add(a, b);
		cout << a << "+" << b << "=" << r << endl;
		break;
	case '-':
		r = Sub(a, b);
		cout << a << "-" << b << "=" << r << endl;
		break;
	case '*':
		r = Mul(a, b);
		cout << a << "*" << b << "=" << r << endl;
		break;
	case '/':
		r = Div(a, b);
		if (r != numeric_limits<float>::min())
		{
			cout << a << "/" << b << "=" << r << endl;
		}
		
		break;
	default:
		cout << "Invalid operator!" << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

float Add(float x, float y)
{
	return x + y;
}

float Sub(float x, float y)
{
	return x - y;
}

float Mul(float x, float y)
{
	return x * y;
}

float Div(float x, float y)
{
	if (y == 0)
	{
		cout << "Denominator can't be zero" << endl;
		return numeric_limits<float>::min();
	}
	else
	{
		return x / y;
	}
}
```

Let's see a simple program which takes the values of a 2 points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and then calculate the Euclidean distance between them using three user-defined functions **float EuclideanDistance (float, float, float, float), float Square(float)** and **float Abs(float)**

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

float Abs(float d);
float Square(float x);
float EuclideanDistance(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2);

int main()
{
	float x1, x2, y1, y2;
	cout << "Enter x1: ";
	cin >> x1;
	
	cout << "Enter y1: ";
	cin >> y1;

	cout << "Enter x2: ";
	cin >> x2;

	cout << "Enter y2: ";
	cin >> y2;

	float dist = EuclideanDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2);
	cout << "Distance : " << dist << endl;
	return 0;
}

/* |d| = sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2) */


/* This function calculates Euclidean Distance between two given points
	|D| = sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 
*	|D| = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)	
*	|D| = sqrt(xx + yy) */

float EuclideanDistance(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2)
{
	
	float x = x1 - x2;
	float y = y1 - y2;
	float xx = Square(x);
	float yy = Square(y);

	float d = sqrt(xx + yy); 
	d = Abs(d);

	return d;
	
	// Alternatively you can use the line below to perform the same task as above in a single line
	//return Abs(sqrt(Square(x1 - x2) + Square(y1 - y2)));
}

float Square(float x)
{
	return x * x;
}

float Abs(float d)
{
	if (d < 0)
	{
		d = d * -1;
	}

	return d;
}
```

And now there is a problem which calculates the gross salary of an employee, given the basic salary of that employee, using the rules below:
* The employee will receive medical allowance which is 10% of the basic salary
* The employee will receive house rent which is 50% of the basic salary
* Tax will be deducted and paid to the goverment on employee's behalf which is 10% of the basic salary
* Provident fund will be deducted from the salary which is 10% of the basic salary

The program below calls the function **float CalSalary(int, float, float, float)** which takes the basic salary, medical allowance percentage, house rent percentage, tax percentage and provident percentage as input and returns the gross salary of the employee


```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

/*
* Basic Salary = x
* Medical Allowance = 10% of Basic Salary (Added to the salary)
* House Rent = 50% of Basic Salary (Added to the salary)
* Tax = 10% of the Basic Salary (Deducted from the salary)
* Provident Fund = 10% of the Basic Salary (Deducted from the Salary)
* Gross salary = Basic Salary + Medical Allowance + House Rent - Tax - Provident Fund
*/
float CalculateSalary(int b, float m, float h, float t, float pf);

int main()
{
	int b_sal;
	float med_allow = 0.1, house_rent = 0.5, tax = 0.1, pf = 0.1;

	cout << "Enter the Basic Salary:";
	cin >> b_sal;

	float gross_salary = CalculateSalary(b_sal, med_allow, house_rent, tax, pf);
	cout << "Gross Salary = " << gross_salary << endl;

	return 0;
}

float CalculateSalary(int b, float m, float h, float t, float pf)
{
	return ((b + b * m + b * h) - (b * t + b * pf));
}
```

## Recursive Functions

Last but not least is an example of the recursive functions. Recursive function is one which calls itself. Right now this recursive functions calls itself for infinite times but later on we will come back to this topic and see some really nice and mindblowing examaples of recursive functions.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void recursiv1();

int main()
{
	cout << "Hello" << endl;
	recursiv1();
	return 0;
}

void recursiv1()
{
	cout << "Get me out of here!!!!!" << endl;
	recursiv1();
}
```

## A Note about Pass by Value

So far we have passed the parameters by passing their values only. This concept is called Pass by Value. Now run the program below and observe that sending the parameters using pass by value method doesn't change the value of variables in the calling fucntion.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int ChangeX(int x);

int main()
{
	int x;
	cout << "Enter any number: ";
	cin >> x;

	x = ChangeX(x);
	cout << x << endl;
	return 0;
}

int ChangeX(int x)
{
	cout << x << endl;
	x = x + 10;
	cout << x << endl;
	return x;
}
```

This problem can be understood with great details when we try to swap two numbers in a function. When we try to **swap two numbers inside a function** then keep in mind that the function receives the values of the variables only and not the variables itself. So you can say that the functions is working on the copy of the variables, not the original values itself. Therefore, swapping is indeed perform in the function and you can see swapped values inside the function, but the moment the control of the compiler returns back to the calling function then garbage collector discards all the variables using inside the function (i.e., the copies of the variables taken as input) and returns back to the original variables which are unchanged actually. So, we can't see the effect of swapping in the calling function which is main() in this case. 

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void Swap(int a, int b);

int main()
{
	int a, b;
	cin >> a >> b;
	Swap(a, b);
	cout << "a=" << a << " b= " << b << endl;
	return 0;
}

void Swap(int a, int b)
{
	int c;
	c = a;
	a = b;
	b = c;
	cout << "a=" << a << " b= " << b << endl;
}
```

In the next tutorial, we will learn iterative statements of C++.
