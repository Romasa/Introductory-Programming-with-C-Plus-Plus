[Previous: If-else and switch-case](3. If-else and Switch case.md)

In the program below, four different functions are written which greets the user with four different languages. These functions accepts no input parameters and returns nothings. In the below version of this program, all the functions are called from main() function. So everytime the control of the program goes to the calling function and returns back to main() function after the execution of the function is finished.
For example, when the InBengali() function is called from the main() function, then the control of compiler leaves the main() function for a while and goes to InBengali() function, once all the statements of the InBengali() functions are completed, the control returns back to the main() function

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;



void InBengali(); // These are Function Prototype / Function Signature
void InGerman();
void InFrench();
void InEnglish();

int main()
{
	InBengali(); // This is how a function is called. Here InBengali() function is called
  InGerman();  // This is how a function is called. Here InGerman() function is called
  InEnglish();  // This is how a function is called. Here InEnglish() function is called
  InFrench();  // This is how a function is called. Here InFrench() function is called
	return 0;
}

// This is the function definition
void InEnglish()
{
	cout << "Good Evening" << endl;
}

// This is the function definition
void InBengali()
{
	cout << "Shubo Shondha " << endl;
}

// This is the function definition
void InGerman()
{
	cout << "Guten Abend" << endl;
}

// This is the function definition
void InFrench()
{
	cout << "Bonjoir" << endl;
}
```

In another version of the above program, functions are not called from the main() functions only, different functions are calling to one another, now run and analyse the result of the following program. For your better understanding, few messages are printed inside the functions.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;



void InBengali(); // Function Prototype / Function Signature
void InGerman();
void InFrench();
void InEnglish();

int main1()
{
	cout << "I am main" << endl;
	InBengali();
	cout << "Exiting from main" << endl;
	return 0;
}

void InEnglish()
{
	cout << "Going to England: ";
	cout << "Good Evening" << endl;
	InGerman();
	cout << "Exiting from England" << endl;
}

void InBengali()
{
	cout << "Going to Bangladesh: ";
	cout << "Shubo Shondha " << endl;
	InEnglish();
	cout << "Exiting from Bangladesh" << endl;
}

void InGerman()
{
	cout << "Going to Germany: ";
	cout << "Guten Abend" << endl;
	InFrench();
	cout << "Exiting from Germany" << endl;
}

void InFrench()
{
	cout << "Going to France: ";
	cout << "Bonjoir" << endl;
	cout << "Exiting from France" << endl;
}

```

The previous problem  calls a function without any parameters and the functions didn't return anything as well. In the example below, main() function is calling a function named calSum() with three parameters/ arguments and getting the sum of these parameters as return. The result returned from calSum() is printed in the main() function.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int calSum(int x, int y, int z);

int main()
{
	int a, b, c;
	cin >> a >> b >> c;

	int result = calSum(a, b, c);
	cout << "sum = " << result <<endl;
	return 0;
}

int calSum(int x, int y, int z)
{
	int r = x + y + z;
	return r;
}
```

Last but not least is an example of the recursive functions. Recursive function is one which calls itself. Right now this recursive functions calls itself for infinite times but later on we will see some really working and mindblowing examaples of recursive functions.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

void recursiv1();

int main2()
{
	cout << "Hello" << endl;
	recursiv1();
	return 0;
}

void recursiv1()
{
	cout << "Get me out of here!!!!!" << endl;
	recursiv1();
}
```
