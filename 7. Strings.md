# Strings

The difference between a character array and a string is mostly theoritical and in practical these two are differentiated by a following '\0' sign. In the case of string, we usually terminate the sequence of characters by placing a '\0' at the end and in the character array, it is not required.

Understand the difference between the character array and string by this simple program:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char grades[5] = { 'A', 'B', 'B', 'F', 'C' }; //This is a character array
	char name[7] = { 'R', 'O', 'M', 'A', 'S', 'A', '\0' }; // This is a string, terminated with '\0'
	
	// Character array doesn't makes sense when combined together, rather each element has its individual meaning
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		cout << grades[i] << endl;
	}

	// String makes sense when printed together
	cout << name << endl;
		return 0;
}
```

As written in the comments of the program, individual items of the character array has their own meaning. For example in this case, individual items of the array refer to the grades of individual students. However, in the case of a string, the combined pronunciation of the individual character of someone's name makes sense. Notice that while printing string variable, no loop and no index number is used. The cout statement is given only the base address of the string which is stored in the character array and terminated properly by the '\0'.


Lets explore string a bit more and see how we can print the number of characters present in the string and lets try to print the string in the reverse order:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char name[] = "Romasa";

	//cout << name << endl;
	 cout << sizeof(name) << endl;
	 
	 //i=6, i=5, i=4, i=3, i=2, i = 1, i=0, i=-1=>F
	for (int i = sizeof(name) - 1; i >= 0; i--) 
	{
		cout << name[i] ; 
		//name[6]= '\0', name[5] ='a', name[4]='s', name[3]='a', name[2] = 'm', name[1]='o', name[0]='R'
	}
	cout << endl;
	printf("%s \n", name);
	return 0;
}
```
