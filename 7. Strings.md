# Strings

The difference between a character array and a string is mostly theoritical and in practical these two are differentiated by a following '\0' sign. In the case of string, we usually terminate the sequence of characters by placing a '\0' at the end and in the character array, it is not required.

Understand the difference between the character array and string by this simple program:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char grades[5] = { 'A', 'B', 'B', 'F', 'C' }; //This is a character array
	char name[7] = { 'R', 'O', 'M', 'A', 'S', 'A', '\0' }; // This is a string, terminated with '\0'
	
	// Character array doesn't makes sense when combined together, rather each element has its individual meaning
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		cout << grades[i] << endl;
	}

	// String makes sense when printed together
	cout << name << endl;
		return 0;
}
```

As written in the comments of the program, individual items of the character array has their own meaning. For example in this case, individual items of the array refer to the grades of individual students. However, in the case of a string, the combined pronunciation of the individual character of someone's name makes sense. Notice that while printing string variable, no loop and no index number is used. The cout statement is given only the base address of the string which is stored in the character array and terminated properly by the '\0'.


Lets explore string a bit more and see how we can print the number of characters present in the string and lets try to print the string in the reverse order:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char name[] = "Romasa";

	//cout << name << endl;
	 cout << sizeof(name) << endl;
	 
	 //i=6, i=5, i=4, i=3, i=2, i = 1, i=0, i=-1=>F
	for (int i = sizeof(name) - 1; i >= 0; i--) 
	{
		cout << name[i] ; 
		//name[6]= '\0', name[5] ='a', name[4]='s', name[3]='a', name[2] = 'm', name[1]='o', name[0]='R'
	}
	cout << endl;
	printf("%s \n", name);
	return 0;
}
```

Now there is an interesting algorithm for encryption and decryption:

```
#include<iostream>
#include "String.h"
using namespace std;

void Encrypt(char p[], char enc[], int len);
void Decrypt(char enc[], char dec[], int len);
bool CheckPassword(char p[], int len);

int main()
{
	int len;
	bool isOK = false;
	char password[100];
	char encrypt[100];
	char decrypt[100];
	do
	{
		cout << "Create password:";
		cin.getline(password, 100); //oki
		len = StrLen(password); // 3
		if (len <= 6)
		{
			cout << "Password should be more than 6 characters" << endl;
		}
		else
		{
			isOK = CheckPassword(password, len);
			if (isOK == false)
			{
				cout << "Password is invalid. Use alphanumeric characters only!" << endl;
			}
		}
	} while (len < 6 || isOK == false);

	cout << "Password created successcully!" << endl;

	Encrypt(password, encrypt, len);
	Decrypt(encrypt, decrypt, len);

	return false;
}
// Checking that the password is in alphanumeric form
// Input: Character array as p and length of the array as len
// Output: if the password is alphanumeric then returns true else returns false
bool CheckPassword(char p[], int len)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
	{ // n5!t11  // !(1) => 0 //  !(0) => 1
		if ((p[i] >= 'A' && p[i] <= 'Z') ||
			(p[i] >= 'a' && p[i] <= 'z') ||
			(p[i] >= '0' && p[i] <= '9')
			)
		{
			continue;
		}
		else
		{
			return false;
		}

	}
	return true;

}

void Encrypt(char p[], char enc[], int len)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
	{
		enc[i] = p[i] + 4;
	}

	cout << "Encrypted password: ";
	for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
	{
		cout << enc[i];
	}
	cout << endl;
}

void Decrypt(char enc[], char dec[], int len)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
	{
		dec[i] = enc[i] - 4;
	}

	cout << "Decrypted password: ";
	for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
	{
		cout << dec[i];
	}
	cout << endl;
}
```
