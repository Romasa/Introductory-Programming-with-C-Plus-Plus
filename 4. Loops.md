# Iterative Statements or Loops
Whenever you want to do some task repetitively then we needs to learn a new tool which can perform this task. This tool is called Iterative Statements or Loops in C++ language. 
There are three different types of loops provided in C++:

1. While Loop
2. For Loop
3. Do-while Loop


## While Loop

While loop provides a very simplistic skeleton to perform the iterative tasks. For example, with the help of while loop, numbers from 1 to 10 can be printed using the following program:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int num = 1;

	while (num <= 10)
	{
		cout << num << endl;
		num = num + 1;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

In the above program, we are doing a repetitive task of printing a number starting from 1 and every time we increment the value of the number so that next number can be printed. This procedures runs for 10 times in the above example.

Lets modify the above program so that inside loop, we can calculate the sum of all the numbers which is provided to us. 
The program below, takes 5 integer numbers as input from the user and perform the summation of those numbers inside the loop. Later on this program prints the result of the summation.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int count = 1;
	float x, sum = 0 ;
	while (count <= 5)
	{
		count++;
		cout << "Enter any value;";
		cin >> x;

		sum = sum + x;
	}
	cout << "Sum = " << sum << endl;
	return 0;
}
```
