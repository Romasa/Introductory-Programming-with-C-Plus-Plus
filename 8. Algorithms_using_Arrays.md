# Some Incredible applications of 1D Arrays

## Sorting

There are few fascinating sorting algorithms like insertion sort, bubble sort, selection sort etc. We are presenting the codes of few of them hhere

### Insertion Sort:
* To read more about insertion sort refer to the lecture slides or [visit to this link](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/insertion-sort/a/insertion-sort)
* To see the animation of insertion sort [Click here](https://yongdanielliang.github.io/animation/web/InsertionSortNew.html)

The code to perform the insertion sort using C++ is given below:

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#define SIZE 1000

void InsertionSort(int a[]);

int main1()
{
	int a[SIZE] ;
	
	for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
	{
		a[i] = rand() % 1000;
		cout << a[i] << ", ";
	}
	cout << endl;

	cout << "After sorting: " << endl;

	InsertionSort(a);

	for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
	{
		cout << a[i] << ", ";
	}
	cout << endl;
	return 0;
}

// Pass by reference
void InsertionSort(int a[]) 
{
	int x;

	for (int i = 1; i < SIZE; i++) 
	{
		x = a[i]; 
		for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
		{
			if (a[j] > x)  
			{
				a[j + 1] = a[j]; 
				a[j] = x;
			}
			else
			{
				break;
			}
		}
	}
}
```


## Searching

The most common and frequent operation which is performed on data is searching. In the examples below we are working with small amount of data but you can change the SIZE of the data to whatever value you want and work on that data.

### Linear Search
This algorithm works with unsorted data and it is best suited for small amount of data. The program below generates 1000 random integer numbers and search for the presence of any given number x. If the number x is present in the data then the program will report that the data is found otherwise it will say that the data is not found.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#define SIZE 1000

int LinearSearch(int a[], int x);

int main()
{
	int a[SIZE];
	int x;
	for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
	{
		a[i] = rand() % 100;
		cout << a[i] << ", ";
	}
	cout << endl;
	cout << "Enter the value to search:";
	cin >> x;
	int ind = LinearSearch(a, x);
	if (ind == -1)
	{
		cout << x << " is not found!" << endl;
	}
	else
	{
		cout << x << " is found at index " << ind << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

int LinearSearch(int a[], int x)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
	{
		if (a[i] == x)
		{
			return i;
		}
	}

	return -1;

}
```

### Binary Search

The binary search algorithm is a very efficient algorithm used to perform searching on very large amount of data. The only limitation to use binary search is that it the **data should be sorted**.

The program below searches the given value x on a *sorted data*. If the value x is present in the data the program will report that the data is found, otherwise it will say that the data isn't found.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#define SIZE 10

int BinarySearch(int a[], int x);

int main()
{
	int a[SIZE] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
	int x;
	for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
	{
		cout << a[i] << ", ";
	}
	cout << endl;

	cout << "Enter the value to search:";
	cin >> x;
	int ind = BinarySearch(a, x);
	if (ind == -1)
	{
		cout << x << " is not found!" << endl;
	}
	else
	{
		cout << x << " is found at index " << ind << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

int BinarySearch(int a[], int x)
{
	int low = 0;
	int high = SIZE - 1;

	int mid;

	while (low <= high)
	{
		mid = (low + high) 
		if (x == a[mid])	
		{
			return mid;
		}
		else if(x > a[mid])
		{
			low = mid + 1;
		}
		else if (x < a[mid])
		{
			high = mid - 1;
		}
	}
	return -1;
}
```
You can rewrite the program above by generating 1000 random values and calling any sorting function to sort the data and then perform binary search on it. Also observe and compare the time it takes to search a number in a large data using linear searching and using binary search method.
