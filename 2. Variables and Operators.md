1. (a) Swapping the content of two variables, using third variable

```

    int a;
    int b;

    cout << "Enter the value of a:";
    cin >> a; //if a = 5

    cout << "Enter the value of b:";
    cin >> b; // and b = 10
    // Swapping the values of two variables using third variable
    int c; // working as a temporary variable
    c = a; // c = 5
    a = b; // a = 10
    b = c; // b = 5

    printf("a = %d, b = %d \n", a, b);
```

1. (b) Swapping the content of two variables without using third variable

```
    int a;
    int b;

    cout << "Enter the value of a:";
    cin >> a; //if a = 5

    cout << "Enter the value of b:";
    cin >> b; // and b = 10
    
    //Swapping the values of two variables without using third variable
    a = a + b; // 5 + 10 => a = 15
    b = a - b; // 15 - 10 = > b = 5 
    a = a - b; // 15 - 5 => a = 10

    cout << "a = " << a;
    cout << ", b = " << b << "\n";

    return 0;
```

2. If a three digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to calculate the sum of its digits. (Hint: use % operator). 

If the given number is 651 then everytime we have to separate one digit and store it in a separate variable. Taking the modulus by 10 gives the last digit of the number everytime. After getting the last digit, we need to chop it from the actual number. If an integer number is divided by integer value of 10, then the last fractional part will be ignored, hence the last digit would be chop out of the actual number. 
Repeating this stretagy 3 times will individually store the digits in three different variables from right to left.
For example if the given number is 651, then: 
    6|5|1 => 6 + 5 + 1 => 12
    1.  651 / 10 => q = 65 , r1 = 1
        2.  65 / 10 => q = 6, r2 = 5
           3.  6 / 10 => q = 0, r3 = 6
 ```
    int num;
    cout << "Enter a three digit number:";
    cin >> num;

    int r1 = num % 10;
    num = num / 10; // 65

    cout << "r1=" << r1 << " num=" << num << endl;
    int r2 = num % 10; 
    num = num / 10;
    cout << "r2=" << r2 << " num=" << num << endl;
    int r3 = num % 10;
    num = num / 10;
    cout << "r3=" << r3 << " num=" << num << endl;
    int sum = r1 + r2 + r3;
    cout << "Sum of all the digits = " << sum << endl;
```

3. The ATM machine can only give out the currency notes of 1000 and 500. Assume that the user has entered the value in the multiples of 500, and then your program should print how many currency notes of 1000 and 500 needs to be dispatched out of the machine. Also, assume that you have unlimited number of 1000 and 500 currency notes. Your program should deliver as least currency notes as possible For example, if the user has entered the amount to be withdrawn to 25500 then your program should print 25 notes of 1000 and 1 note of 500. (Hint: use % operator)

```
    int amount, thousands, fivehundreds;
    cout << "Enter the amount to be dispatched: ";
    cin >> amount;

    thousands = amount / 1000;
    amount = amount % 1000;
    fivehundreds = amount / 500;

    cout << "Number of 1000 notes: " << thousands;
    cout << ", number of 500 notes: " << fivehundreds <<endl;
```

4. Given a floating point number, write a program to separate the integral and decimal part. For example, if the given number is 2.541 then your program should print integral part 2 and decimal part 0.541 separately.

```
float num;
    int integral;
    float decimal;
    cout << "Enter a floating point number:";
    cin >> num;

    integral = (int)num;
    cout << "integral part = " << integral << endl;
    
    decimal = num - integral;

    cout << "decimal part = " << decimal << endl;
```

5. Given a character as input print its ASCII Code

```
char c;
    cout << "Enter any character:";
    cin >> c;

    //cout << "ASCII of " << c << " is " << (int)c << endl;
    printf("ASCII of c is %d\n", c);

```

6. Given an ASCII Code as integer, print its associated character as mentioned in ASCII table

```
    int a = 73;
    cout << (char)a << endl;
    printf("%c", a);
```
7. Given an uppercase letter as input, print the same letter in smallcase

```
char ch;
    cout << "Enter any upper case letter: ";
    cin >> ch;

    ch = ch + 32;
    cout << ch << endl;
```

Have a nice day!
