# Arrays

So far we have worked with individual variables, if ever we want to store bulk information of similar values then we have to use Arrays.

The program below, represents how an array of integer, double and character type can be created and how they are stored in contiguous memory locations and can be accessed with a single name with distinct and sequential index numbers.

Few facts should be noted to better understand the program below

1. Size of a single integer variable is 4 bytes
2. Size of a single double variable is 8 bytes
3. Size of a single char variable is 1 byte
4. The base address of the array is the address of the 0th index item of the whole array

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int a;
	int arr[10]; // Declaration of an integer array named 'arr'
	char car[10]; // Declaration of a char array named 'car'
	double d[10]; //// Declaration of a double-type array named 'd'
	a = 5;
	cout << "Representation of integer array:" << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	{
		arr[i] = i*10;
		cout << arr[i] ;
		cout << " is stored at memory location " << &arr[i] << endl; 
	}
	cout << endl;
	cout << "Representation of double-type array:" << endl;
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	{
		d[i] = i * 10;
		cout << d[i];
		cout << " is stored at memory location " << &d[i] << endl;
	}

	cout << endl;
	cout << "Representation of char-type array:" << endl;
	for (int i = 0, x=65; i < 10; i++,x++)
	{
		car[i] = x;
		cout << car[i];
		cout << " is stored at memory location ";
		printf("%x \n", &car[i]);
	}
	//cout << a << endl; // Prints the value of the variable a
	//cout << &a << endl;  // Prints the address of the variable a

	return 0;

}
```

How to store and print the contents of a character array in a naive way can be seen in this program.

```
int main()
{
	char greet[5];
	greet[0] = 'H';
	greet[1] = 'e';
	greet[2] = 'l';
	greet[3] = 'l';
	greet[4] = 'o';

	cout << greet[0];
  cout << greet[1];
  cout << greet[2];
  cout << greet[3];
  cout << greet[4];
	
	return 0;
}
```

The program below stores the characters from A (ASCII Code 65) to Z (ASCII Code 90) into a character array and calls a function to print the entire array elements in a better way. Later on another function Upper2Lower() is called to convert the contents of array from upper case characters to lower case characters by adding the difference of 'a' to 'A'.  This program will help you to understand how an array can be passed to a function as an argument.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void PrintArray(char c[26]); 
void Upper2Lower(char c[26]);

int main()
{
	char carr[26]; // Declaring a character array of size 26

	char x = 'A'; // ASCII code of 'A' is 65

	for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++, x++)
	{
		carr[i] = x;
	}

	PrintArray(carr);
	Upper2Lower(carr);
	PrintArray(carr);
}
/*
* function to print the contents of the given array
* Function name:  PrintArray
* Input: Base address of the array
* Output: void
*/
void PrintArray(char c[26])
{
	for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
	{
		cout << c[i];
		if (i < 25)
		{
			cout << ", ";
		}
	}
	cout << endl;
}

void Upper2Lower(char c[26])
{
	// converting from upper case alphabets to lower case alphabets
	// ASCII code of 'a' is 97
	//  'a' - 'A'  = 97 - 65 => 32
	// 'A' + 32 = 'a' => 65 + 32 = 97

	for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
	{
		c[i] = c[i] + 32;
	}
}
```

Let's see a more realistic problem when we have to store the marks of the students in the class. Since it is the similar type of information where we need to store in bulk, therefore array is an ideal choice to store the marks of some students in the class.
The program below stores the marks of 5 students, calculates their class average and print the students' marks along with the class average.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int marks[5];
	float sum = 0, avg;

	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		cout << "Enter marks?";
		cin >> marks[i];

		sum = sum + marks[i];
	}
	avg = sum / 5;

	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		cout << "Marks of Student # " << i + 1 << " : " << marks[i] << endl;
	}
	cout << "-------------------------------" << endl;
	cout << "Average of the class = " << avg << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

Lets see another program where we need to store the temparature of 5 different cities. The program then finds the maximum temperature of all by calling a function which receives the array as an argument and returns the maximum value of the temperature.
Please observe the use of macro **#default size 5** which is used to declare a constant value *5* whenever we refer the name *size*. The macros works at the compile time and replaces all the occurances of name *size* with value *5* before going to the execution.

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

#define size 5
float FindMax(float t[size]);

int main()
{
	float temp[size];
	
	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
	{
		cout << "Enter the temperature of city # " << i + 1 << ": ";
		cin >> temp[i];
	}

	float max = FindMax(temp);
	cout << "Maximum temperature is " << max << endl;

}

float FindMax(float t[size])
{
	float mx = t[0];
	for (int i = 1; i < size; i++)
	{
		if (mx < t[i])
		{
			mx = t[i];
		}
	}

	return mx;
}
```
